      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In May of 2024, I took a trip to Japan with a couple of my friends. Japan was one of my dream destinations so when my friends brought it up
         in conversation, I instantly agreed to go. We went to a couple different cities, including Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa.
      </p>
      <h2 class="cities">Tokyo</h2>
      <p>Tokyo is a very busy and bustling city. The city is always populated morning to night. I had a great time exploring and looking for things I had saved that either wanted
         to visit or see. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="cities">Kyoto</h2>
      <p>This was my favorite city. It is much more quiet and peaceful compared to Tokyo. My friends and I spent most of our time in Kyoto shopping around a little and relaxing mainly.
         My favorite part of this city was the night life. We spent a night just relaxing and talking at the Sanjō Ōhashi Bridge. There was a light current with street performers
         playing music. One of the most memorable portions of the trip.</p>
      <h2 class="cities">Osaka</h2>
      <p>Osaka is also a very busy city but more in terms of foot traffic. There are so many street food options it feels a little overwhelming, but they all tasted amazing. My favorite
         part of Osaka was visiting a dog cafe. There you can get unlimited drinks and play with dogs for about &yen;1,500 an hour. I also visited a tackle store there since fishing is one
         of my favorite hobbies. There I bought a bunch of japanese exclusive lures that I took back for me and my granpda.
      </p>
      <h2 class="cities">Okinawa</h2>
      <p>Okinawa wasn't what I was expecting. Before we arrived, we had planned to visit the beach there and to go to a well known aquarium. We weren't able to do that since as soon as
         we landed, we got hit with a rain storm and it lasted the whole time we were there. We made the best of it though using the time at the hotel to watch movies and order food in and
         just relax.
